Once you have your transcript, it is recommended to check for common and repeated errors.
For example, "ZK" is often transcribed as "CK" or "Aligned" as "Align".

You can run the transcript through an LLM to correct these errors, and also assign speaker names in media with multiple speakers.

Once you are happy with the content, find the appropriate folder, depending on format, and submit a PR to add your transcription to the archive.

Current folders are /xspace and /video.

Your file should contain a header using the below format.

Once you have submitted your PR, please send us the link via a support ticket in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/alignedlayer)
